/*Write a program to input the Principal, Rate, and Time values and calculate Simple Interest.
Hint => 
Simple Interest = Principal * Rate * Time / 100
Take user input for principal, rate, time
Write a method to calculate the simple interest given principle, rate and time as parameters
Output “The Simple Interest is ___ for Principal ___, Rate of Interest ___ and Time ___”
