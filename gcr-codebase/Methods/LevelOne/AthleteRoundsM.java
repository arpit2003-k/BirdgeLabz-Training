/*An athlete runs in a triangular park with sides provided as input by the user in meters. If the athlete wants to complete a 5 km run, then how many rounds must the athlete complete
Hint => 
Take user input for 3 sides of a triangle 
The perimeter of a triangle is the addition of all sides and rounds is distance/perimeter
Write a Method to compute the number of rounds user needs to do to complete 5km run
