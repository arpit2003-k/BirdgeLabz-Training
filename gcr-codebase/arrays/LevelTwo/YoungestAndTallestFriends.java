   /*Create a program to find the youngest friends among 3 Amar, Akbar, and Anthony based on their ages and the tallest among the friends based on their heights
Hint => 
Take user input for age and height for the 3 friends and store it in two arrays each to store the values for age and height of the 3 friends
Loop through the array and find the youngest of the 3 friends and the tallest of the 3 friends
Finally display the youngest and tallest of the 3 friends
