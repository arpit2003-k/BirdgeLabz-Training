/*1. Number Guessing Game:
○ Write a Java program where the user thinks of a number between 1 and 100, and
the computer tries to guess the number by generating random guesses.
○ The user provides feedback by indicating whether the guess is high, low, or
correct. The program should be modular, with different functions for generating
guesses, receiving user feedback, and determining the next guess.*/
