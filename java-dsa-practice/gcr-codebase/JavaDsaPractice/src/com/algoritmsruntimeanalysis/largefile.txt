Java is a high-level, class-based, object-oriented programming language and computing platform first released by Sun Microsystems in 1995. Its core philosophy is "Write Once, Run Anywhere" (WORA), meaning Java code compiled into an intermediate bytecode can execute on any device that has a Java Virtual Machine (JVM) installed, without needing recompilation. Known for its robustness, security, and automatic memory management (garbage collection), Java is widely used today for building a vast range of applications, from Android mobile apps and enterprise software to cloud-based solutions and large-scale data processing systems like Hadoop and Apache Kafka. Its stable platform, rich standard library (Java API), and large, active community support have ensured its enduring popularity among developers.
